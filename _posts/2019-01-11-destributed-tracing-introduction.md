## Destributed Tracing Introduction

### What is destributed tracing?
Destributed tracing is a process of collecting and showing transaction graphs in near realtime. It shows you what is going on with your request to application and help you with latency processes.
To have a better understanding let's review few difinitions:

> Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.

> Distributed tracing is the process of tracking the activity resulting from a request to an application. With this feature, you can:
> * Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system
> * Discover the latency of the components along that path
> * Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck
