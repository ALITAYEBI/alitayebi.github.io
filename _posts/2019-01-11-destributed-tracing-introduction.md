## Destributed Tracing Introduction

### What is destributed tracing?

Destributed tracing is a process of collecting and showing transaction graphs in near realtime. It lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. You can see the what is really going on with your request and helps with latency processes.

To have a better understanding let's review few difinitions:

> Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.    - [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/what-is-tracing/)


> Distributed tracing is the process of tracking the activity resulting from a request to an application. With this feature, you can:
> * Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system
> * Discover the latency of the components along that path
> * Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck    - [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing#definition)
